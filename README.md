# SimplePie RFC Documents

Requests for Change documents. Similar to PSR, PEP, JSR, and other document-oriented changes.

Documents will go by `SPEP`, which stands for _SimplePie Enhancement Proposal_. Since they may include other "metadata" documentation, each one will live in it's own subdirectory. This is the pattern adopted by the PHP-FIG, so there is some precedent there.

## Common Terms

1. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

1. "Support" or "Supported" refer to the fact that we (humans) will _provide support_ and/or _actively test_ particular software. It **does not** refer to (and makes no claims about) whether or not particular software _functions_ in a given environment context (machines).

1. "SimplePie Core Team" is defined by [`simplepie/.github`](https://github.com/simplepie/.github).

1. "SimplePie" refers to the overarching SimplePie project, which may include any of the sub-projects under the SimplePie umbrella. It does not implicitly or explicitly refer to any particular repository of code.

1. "SimplePie NG", "Feed Locator", "Text Encoder", and other names refer to their specific project repositories.

1. "SimplePie OG" refers to the original `simplepie/simplepie` repository, and is a play-on-words. In "SimplePie NG", the "NG" stands for _Next-Generation_. "NG" is similar to "OG", and "OG" is a slang acronym for _original gangsta_, or sometimes _old gee_, where "gee" is short for _gangsta_. From this term, we derive "original" (or "old"), referring to the original SimplePie project.

## Expectation of Adoption

These documents are expected to apply to all repositories (as appropriate) inside this GitHub organization with the following exceptions:

1. Archived repositories are exempted from these documents.

1. The original `simplepie/simplepie` repository (aka, "SimplePie Classic", "SimplePie OG") is exempted from these documents.
