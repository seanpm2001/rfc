# SimplePie RFC Documents

Requests for Change documents. Similar to PSR, PEP, JSR, and other document-oriented changes.

Documents will go by `SPEP`, which stands for _SimplePie Enhancement Proposal_. Since they may include other "metadata" documentation, each one will live in it's own subdirectory.

This is the pattern adopted by the PHP-FIG, so there is some precedent there.
